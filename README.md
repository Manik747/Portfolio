    -uses grid to arrange content
    -JS to manage modals
    -SASS for styling

Design 
    -Wanted all the conntent to feel like it was on one page.

Q & A 
A key event that marked the development of the internet was the linking of hypertext documents into an information system in the 1980s which allowed us to view the first rudimentary websites. Another large part came even earlier with the creation of packet switching. The concept that information could be split into packets. The routes of these packets would take was decided on sending Allowed for better use of bandwidth. Initially internet systems where created for governments and militray but by the 1980s was becoming a widespread concept! 

A domain is an I string that is ultimately formed by the DNS, which is a set of rules and procedures. A domain name is represents an IP. A code unique to each computer on the internet. Ip addresses can change from computer to computer but are generally static for Web servers. A web server uses HTTP to send files from web pages to a computer when requested from the internet into there relevant browsers. 

Just google it. Our lives have been dramatically changed by the internet by sheer access to information. No longer do we have to pour through libraries to get answers to questions when a quick search will generally result in the answer we are looking for. This has also allowed people to connect on multiple different levels around the world. Internet is almost equivalent with gas, electricity or water in a house.
